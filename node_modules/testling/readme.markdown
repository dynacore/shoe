# testling

Run [testling-ci](http://ci.testling.com) tests locally.

# example

write a test:

``` js
var test = require('tape');

test('beep boop', function (t) {
    t.plan(2);
    t.equal(1+1, 2);
    t.ok(true);
});
```

run your test in a local headless browser:

```
$ browserify example/test.js | testling

TAP version 13
# beep boop
ok 1 should be equal
ok 2 (unnamed assert)

1..2
# tests 2
# pass  2

# ok
```

with an exit code of 0 for successes and non-zero for failures like a good unix
citizen

Once you have a `package.json` with a configured `"testling"` field, you can just
type:

```
$ testling
```

to run all your tests locally just like they will be run on
[testling-ci](https://ci.testling.com). This includes mocha harnesses, scripts,
and files parameters.

# usage

```
usage: testling {DIRECTORY|-} {OPTIONS}

If there (is no DIRECTORY and stdin is a tty) or the DIRECTORY is "-",
javascript will be read from stdin and executed.

Otherwise, DIRECTORY (or the $CWD) will be checked for a package.json with a
testling field.

OPTIONS are:

      -x  Launch a browser with an explicit command. By default, chrome or
          firefox is launched by searching your $PATH.

      -u  Instead of launching a browser, print the url to visit so you can open
          the browser yourself.

  --html  Instead of launching a server, show the generated html.

```

# install

First, install `browserify` globally so that the `testling` command can find it
when there is no `browserify` in `./node_modules/.bin`:

```
npm install -g browserify
```

then do:

```
npm install -g testling
```
